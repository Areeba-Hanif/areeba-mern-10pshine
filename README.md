 Project Overview

The Notes Management Application is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack. The application enables users to securely create, edit, view, and delete personal notes. Each user’s data is protected through authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure privacy and data integrity.

This project is being developed as part of the 10P SHINE MERN Internship Program and follows enterprise-level software development practices, including clean architecture, structured logging, centralized error handling, unit testing, and static code analysis.
